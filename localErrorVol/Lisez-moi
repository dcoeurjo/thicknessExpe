english.

Usage :  Compute local and global error on thickness values got with volumic method.
--------

The programm creates noised meshes with 3 types of noises :
- A gaussian noise for each coordinate ( "Cubic noise"  );
- A gaussian noise for each coordinate but filtered to stay in a sphere ( "Spheric noise" ) ;
- A gaussian noise along the local normal for each vertex ( "Normal noise" ).
They are stored in .OFF files. You can choose the type of noise and also the different 
magnitudes of noise ( stored in a .TXT file )

The programm also computes the local and global error on the thickness, and stores these datas 
in .TXT files. It generates gnuplot scripts to plot them into a PDF file.

Needed 
-------

- cmake
- CGAL ( generate noise )
- binvox ( voxelisation )


How to compile
---------------

in the localErrorSDF repository :

$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake ..    ( 2 times to include -std=gnu++0x ( gaussian generator...))
$ make

How to use the programm
------------------------

in the build repository :

$ ./localErrorSDF path/to/the/mesh.off path/to/the/ option 

where option is :
  1 for the "Cubic noise"
  2 for the "Spheric noise"
  3 for the "Normal noise"

and resolution is the resolution of the voxelized images creates in the programm.

example : to compare the local error with a normal noise on a mesh ( path : ~/Documents/
my_mesh.off ) with the magnitudes in magnitudes.txt ( in localErrorVol repository ), with
a resolution 150x150x150 :

./localErrorSDF ~/Documents/my_mesh.off ../magnitudes.txt 3 150
