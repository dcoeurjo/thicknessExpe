repartition150.pdf :
-------------------- 

Repartition of the thickness values for a resolution 150x150x150.
We can distinguish easily a correct mean radius ( next to the maximal radius ), and a weak variance.

compareSdfThick :
------------------

Compare the thickness cumulative distribution compute by the SDF method and a volumic method ( with different
resolutions ) based on the Medial Axis computation.
The two profiles are really different, but be careful : the two curves have been normalized by the maximal radius
found with each method. Nevertheless, the volumic profile must be more convenient than the SDF profile.
