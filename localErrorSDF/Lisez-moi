| Build noised meshes and compare the local error on SDF values |
*---------------------------------------------------------------*

Note : Sorry if you find language faults in this document, the author hasn't got a perfect 
english.

Usage :
--------

In this programm, you can create noised meshes with 3 types of noises :
- A gaussian noise for each coordinate ( "Cubic noise"  );
- A gaussian noise for each coordinate but filtered to stay in a sphere ( "Spheric noise" ) ;
- A gaussian noise along the local normal for each vertex ( "Normal noise" ).
They are stored in .OFF files. You can choose the type of noise and the different magnitudes 
of noise ( they mush have to be stored in a .TXT file )

The programm also computes the local error on the thickness got by the Shape Diameter Function 
( SDF ) for each face, and also the global error. These values are written in .TXT files.
The programm generates gnuplot scripts to plot them into a PDF file.

Needed 
-------

- cmake
- CGAL


How to compile
---------------

in the localErrorSDF directory

$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake ..    ( 2 times to include -std=gnu++0x ...)
$ make

How to use the programm
------------------------

in the build directory :

$ ./localErrorSDF path/to/the/mesh.off path/to/the/magnitudes.txt option 

where possible options are :
  1 for the "Cubic noise"
  2 for the "Spheric noise"
  3 for the "Normal noise"

example : to get a normal noise on a mesh ( path : ~/Documents/my_mesh.off ) with the 
magnitudes in the build directory :

./localErrorSDF ~/Documents/my_mesh.off magnitudes_example.txt 3
