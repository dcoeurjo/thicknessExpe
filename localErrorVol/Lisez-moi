Usage :
--------

In this programm, you can create noised meshes with 3 types of noises :
- A gaussian noise for each coordinate ( "Cubic noise"  );
- A gaussian noise for each coordinate but filtered to stay in a sphere ( "Spheric noise" ) ;
- A gaussian noise along the local normal for each vertex ( "Normal noise" ).
They are stored in .OFF files. You can choose the type of noise and also the different magnitudes of noise ( for this one, 
you have to change them in the .CPP file ) ;

The programm also computes the local error on the thickness got by the Shape Diameter Function ( SDF ) and the global 
error, and stores these datas in .TXT files. It generates gnuplot scripts to plot them into a PDF file.

Needed 
-------

- cmake
- CGAL


How to compile
---------------

in the localErrorSDF repository :

$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake ..    ( 2 times to include -std=gnu++0x ...)
$ make

How to use the programm
------------------------

in the build repository :

$ ./localErrorSDF path/to/the/mesh.off option 

where option =
  1 for the "Cubic noise"
  2 for the "Spheric noise"
  3 for the "Normal noise"

example : to get a normal noise on a mesh ( path : ~/Documents/my_mesh.off ) :

./localErrorSDF ~/Documents/my_mesh.off 3
