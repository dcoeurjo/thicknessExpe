| Compare different types of noise |
*----------------------------------*

Usage :
-------

This program computes the distributions of the local error in the SDF values, for a mesh 
in OFF file, with a given resolution, for 3 different types of noise :
- A gaussian noise in a cube ( x, y and z are gaussians )
- A gaussian noise in a sphere ( x, y and z are gaussians to, but we check that x²+y²+z² <= r )
- A gaussian noise along the local unit normal to the vertex.

The resolution is defined as a percentage of the longest diagonal of the bounding box of the 
mesh.

More precisely, it creates several OFF files corresponding to noised meshes and compute the 
SDF values using CGAL tools.

Needed :
---------

cmake
CGAL

How to compile :
----------------

$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake ..      ( two times to include -std=gnu++0x for the random generator, weird... )
$ make 

How to use the programm :
--------------------------

./compareNoises path/to/the/object.off my_resolution

example : ./compareNoises ~/Documents/my_object.off 1.5
