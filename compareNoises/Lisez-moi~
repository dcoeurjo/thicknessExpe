| Compare different types of noise |
*----------------------------------*

Usage :
-------

This program computes the distributions of the local error in the SDF values, for a mesh in OFF
file, with a given resolution, for 3 different types of noise :
- A gaussian noise in a cube ( x, y and z are gaussians )
- A gaussian noise in a sphere ( x, y and z are gaussians to, but we assert : x²+y²+z² <= r )
- A gaussian noise along the local unit normal to the vertex.

The resolution is defined as a percentage of the longest diagonal of the bounding box of the mesh.

Needed :
---------

cmake

How to compile :
----------------

$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make 

How to use the programm :
--------------------------

./compareNoises path/to/the/object.off my_resolution

example : ./compareNoises ~/Documents/my_object.off 1.5
